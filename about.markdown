I'm an artist, a well-rounded maker, a self-taught programmer, and a Mathematics graduate from UCLA. My work often combines abstract, high-level thinking with practical hands-on work, and I'm as comfortable building furniture as I am writing code. My favorite projects are those that allow me to do both — designing with the aid of computers and mathematical principles, and then working with my hands to make a tangible finished product. That said, I've done plenty of software-only projects as well as practical builds.

In my downtime I like to learn about science, engineering, psychology, history, and philosophy. I love sci-fi, live music, rock climbing, playing pool, and exploring the natural beauty of the Earth.

Here's my resumé!
